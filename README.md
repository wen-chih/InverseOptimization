## Inverse Optimization for Linear Programs

This package solves inverse optimization (IO) problems for linear programs (LPs), with a focus on recovering objective-function coefficients.

## Models
The package provides two IO models:
- **Strict**: assumes the given solutions are optimal.
- **Robust**: accommodates noisy data.

## Features
- Inverse optimization for LPs
- Sample generation utilities
- Gurobi-based LP solving

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Gurobi Optimizer
