## Section
- This project addresses inverse optimization (IO) problems for linear programs (LPs), focusing on objective-function coefficient recovery. It supports two models—Strict (exact optimality) and Robust (noisy data)—and includes sample generation utilities. Gurobi is used as the LP solver.
- This project is supported by the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 111-2221-E-A49 -080 -MY3.
